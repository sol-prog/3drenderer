# 3drenderer

Code written while following Pikuma course [Learn 3D Computer Graphics Programming](https://pikuma.com/courses/learn-3d-computer-graphics-programming).

The f22.obj and cube.obj models from assets are from the course material.

The code follows the ideas of the course, but it has a different structure and implementation.
